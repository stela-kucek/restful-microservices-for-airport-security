## RESTFUL Microservices for Airport Security

This repository contains my solutions for a course assignment divided into four partial tasks a-d.  The overall topic is the development of an airport security system based on microservices instead of a monolithic architecture. 

### About

The core idea is the utilization of Object Detection via Google Vision API in order to detect suspicious human faces detected on security footage. The microservices are (Docker-) containerized RESTful services which are able to communicate with each other over HTTP requests within an internal network. Tasks a & b served as "warm-up" for task c, which includes all relevant services within a complex, interconnected system. The final phase, task d is all about running the system with Kubernetes on the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This project **cannot be run and used locally**, it should be considered a means of demonstrating the technologies I've worked with and showcase my programming style in Python.
